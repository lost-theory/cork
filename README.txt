Cork
    by Alex Morega (http://grep.ro)

== Description ==

Cork aims to be a generic-purpose information repository that stores data in
"notes" (YAML files) which may contain Python code. Planned features include a
bootstrapper (to easily create a repository), a WSGI publisher (to interact with
notes from e.g. a web browser) and prototypal inheritance (so notes can inherit
each other's data and code).
